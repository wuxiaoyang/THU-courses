# Advanced-Machine-Learning Homework 1
## Logistic Regression Implementation

**Introduction**

This repository contains homework No.1 during course "Advanced Machine Learning".

Goal of Homework 1 is to implement logistic regression to classify the given set of documents as one of two classes "+1 or -1".

+ Documents are from two news groups:
	- Hockey
	- Baseball

+ Document Structure
	- From (email address)
	- Subject
	- Body

+ Partitioned into 5 subsets (s1-s5) for cross validation

We can extract features from raw texts using many methods, like:

- Bag of words
- Tf-idf weighting

In fact, I use bag-of-words method to get features.
